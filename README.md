Example pipeline and instructions for utilizing a Raspberry Pi for proccessing in parallel with the roboRIO for First Robotics Competition

## Preface

I have not had a chance to test this, so there may be a good amount of simple errors like spelling mistakes. In the case you find one, please open an issue or a pull request.

## Setup

Follow the instructions listed [here](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/vision-processing/wpilibpi/index.html) made by wpilibs.

## Access Pi

Once the image is flashed, the pi is turned on, and the pi has been connected to the roborio over network tables,
the Raspberry Pi's user interface can be accessed by going to [wpilibpi.local](http://wpilibpi.local/).

It is given a dynamic ip address by default, however, can be set to be static.
